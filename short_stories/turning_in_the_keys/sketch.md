# Turning in the keys

First attempt at etherpunk short story. Explores a man's decision to become a monk in a blockchain future.

## Basic premise

Man decides to enter monastery, or rather a buddhist DAO. Initiation requires giving up all private keys. All flows of value, e.g. 'dividends' from DAOs, and information are directed back to where they came from and all available funds donated to charity. A kind of blockchain 'ego death' or dissolution of the self. All that remains is a public key shared by all monks of the same DAO. Distribution of received funds are of course governed by a contract that no monk can manipulate. The DAO collects donations and uses funds to feed and house the monks. All surplus funds are immediately donated to charity (haven't quite figured out what 'charity' means yet).

In preparation for ordination, the monk has already lived under several self-imposed 'contracts', e.g. limiting his funds to a certain cap, prohibiting purchases of different things (drugs, alcohol, sex), prohibiting access to VR etc. He has also volunteered to teach machines how to meditate (in this world AIs are strong but not 'superhuman')

Monks receive donations through contact with people (NFC or similar future tech) who have setup a contract in which they set a maximum amount they want to give until the contract expires (probably renewed every year, like an enforced new year's resolution). Some people also setup contracts that makes them donate money upon certain triggers, such as doing things they aren't proud of.

## Setting
Last ride through town in a self-driving vehicle before 'turning in the keys', observing a not-so-distant-future blockchain world while reminiscing his past.
